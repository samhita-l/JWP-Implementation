    "# JWT Implimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "![JWT](https://files.catbox.moe/t69vm3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a JWT (JSON Web Token)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) serve as a secure means of transmitting information in JSON format, providing a way to establish trust between different parties in a web application. \n",
    "- Typically used to transmit information about an authenticated user and additional metadata (usernames, user ID, email, roles, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parts of a JWT:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parts](https://files.catbox.moe/19taua.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each section is divided by a dot\n",
    "- Header (red): Contains information about how the JWT is encoded, such as the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used.\n",
    "- Payload (purple): Contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.\n",
    "- Signature (teal): Created by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret (or key) using the specified algorithm. This signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HMAC and RSA or ECDSA Keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used for signing JWT tokens\n",
    "- HMAC Algorithm (Secret Key): \n",
    "  - HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)\n",
    "  - A secret key is used to both create and verify the signature.\n",
    "  - The issuer (who creates the JWT) uses a secret key and a hashing algorithm to create a signature by combining the encoded header and payload.\n",
    "  - The recipient (who validates the JWT) uses the same secret key to independently calculate the signature and verify that it matches the one provided in the JWT.\n",
    "  - Symmetric key solution: same key used for signing and verification\n",
    "- RSA or ECDSA (Public/Private Key Pair):\n",
    "  - RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) or ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)\n",
    "  - A pair of keys is used: a private key for signing and a corresponding public key for verification.\n",
    "  - The issuer signs the JWT using their private key, and the signature is included in the JWT.\n",
    "  - The recipient, who wants to verify the JWT, uses the public key associated with the issuer to check the signature's validity.\n",
    "  - Asymmetric key solution: private key is kept secret, and only the public key is shared."

    "### Rest APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface)\n",
    "- Architectural style for designing networked applications\n",
    "- Set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services that adhere to the principles of REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principals of REST:\n",
    "- Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server should not store any information about the client's state between requests. This makes the system scalable and easy to maintain.\n",
    "- Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests, managing resources, and handling business logic.\n",
    "- Uniform Interface: RESTful APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, which simplifies the architecture and promotes a clear separation of concerns. The uniform interface is defined by several constraints, including resource identification through URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), resource manipulation through representations, and self-descriptive messages.\n",
    "- Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML, which can be selected based on the client's needs or capabilities. The representation contains the current state of the resource.\n",
