    "# JWT Implimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "![JWT](https://files.catbox.moe/t69vm3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a JWT (JSON Web Token)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) serve as a secure means of transmitting information in JSON format, providing a way to establish trust between different parties in a web application. \n",
    "- Typically used to transmit information about an authenticated user and additional metadata (usernames, user ID, email, roles, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parts of a JWT:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parts](https://files.catbox.moe/19taua.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each section is divided by a dot\n",
    "- Header (red): Contains information about how the JWT is encoded, such as the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used.\n",
    "- Payload (purple): Contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.\n",
    "- Signature (teal): Created by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret (or key) using the specified algorithm. This signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HMAC and RSA or ECDSA Keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used for signing JWT tokens\n",
    "- HMAC Algorithm (Secret Key): \n",
    "  - HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)\n",
    "  - A secret key is used to both create and verify the signature.\n",
    "  - The issuer (who creates the JWT) uses a secret key and a hashing algorithm to create a signature by combining the encoded header and payload.\n",
    "  - The recipient (who validates the JWT) uses the same secret key to independently calculate the signature and verify that it matches the one provided in the JWT.\n",
    "  - Symmetric key solution: same key used for signing and verification\n",
    "- RSA or ECDSA (Public/Private Key Pair):\n",
    "  - RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) or ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)\n",
    "  - A pair of keys is used: a private key for signing and a corresponding public key for verification.\n",
    "  - The issuer signs the JWT using their private key, and the signature is included in the JWT.\n",
    "  - The recipient, who wants to verify the JWT, uses the public key associated with the issuer to check the signature's validity.\n",
    "  - Asymmetric key solution: private key is kept secret, and only the public key is shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Well Suited for APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compact Format: JWTs are compact in size, as they are encoded in a way that minimizes the amount of data transmitted. This is particularly beneficial in web environments where minimizing data transfer is important for efficiency.\n",
    "- URL-Safe Encoding: JWTs are encoded using URL-safe Base64, which means that the resulting token can be safely included in URLs without the need for additional encoding. This makes them convenient for passing tokens as part of URLs in web applications.\n",
    "- Self-Contained: A JWT contains all the necessary information within the token itself. The claims, which include information about the user and additional metadata, are embedded in the token. This eliminates the need for the recipient to make additional database queries or API calls to validate or retrieve information associated with the token.\n",
    "- Statelessness: JWTs are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store session information. The necessary information is included in the token itself, allowing the server to validate and process the token without relying on a centralized session store.\n",
    "- Ease of Integration: JWTs are widely supported and can be easily integrated into various programming languages and frameworks. This interoperability makes them a popular choice for authentication and authorization mechanisms in web APIs.\n",
