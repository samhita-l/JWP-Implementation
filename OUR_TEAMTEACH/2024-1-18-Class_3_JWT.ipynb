    "- Architectural style for designing networked applications\n",
    "- Set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services that adhere to the principles of REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principals of REST-\n",
    "- Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server should not store any information about the client's state between requests. This makes the system scalable and easy to maintain.\n",
    "- Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests, managing resources, and handling business logic.\n",
    "- Uniform Interface: RESTful APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, which simplifies the architecture and promotes a clear separation of concerns. The uniform interface is defined by several constraints, including resource identification through URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), resource manipulation through representations, and self-descriptive messages.\n",
    "- Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML, which can be selected based on the client's needs or capabilities. The representation contains the current state of the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST APIs and JWT:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Java Web Token (JWT) is often used in the context of RESTful APIs to secure and authenticate communication between clients and servers.\n",
    "- Authentication and Authorization: When a client makes a request to a RESTful API, the server may need to verify the identity of the client and determine whether the client has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation. JWTs can be used to securely transmit authentication information (such as user identity and roles) between the client and server.\n",
    "- Stateless Communication: RESTful APIs typically follow the stateless constraint, meaning that each request from the client to the server should contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. JWTs provide a way to include authentication and authorization information directly within the token, eliminating the need for the server to store session state.\n",
    "- Token-Based Authentication: Instead of relying on sessions and cookies, which are commonly used in traditional web applications, JWTs allow for token-based authentication. When a user logs in, the server issues a JWT containing relevant user information and a signature to ensure its integrity. The client then includes this token in the headers of subsequent requests, allowing the server to authenticate and authorize the user.\n",
    "- Secure Transmission: JWTs can be signed and, optionally, encrypted, providing a secure way to transmit information between the client and server. The server can verify the integrity of the token by checking its signature, ensuring that the information it contains has not been tampered with."

    "- When a user logs in, the server generates a token (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Token) containing user information and possibly permissions.\n",

    "2. Cookie Storage and Retrieval:\n",
    "- The cookie is typically stored in the user's browser. It includes attributes such as domain, path, expiration time, and the secure flag.\n",

    "3. Transmission in HTTP Request:\n",
    "- When the user makes an HTTP request to the server (e.g., by navigating to a different page or sending an AJAX request), the browser includes the cookies associated with the domain in the request headers.\n",
